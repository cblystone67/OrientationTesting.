# The 7 basics of Coding

# Variables.

# Math & Logic: write & evaluate expressions (like 2+4, x or y)

# Input/Output: get info from the user (or file/DB) and display info to the screen graphically or with the console/terminal

# Conditions: changing what code is executed based on information for different scenarios (if the day is Sunday, sleep in; otherwise, get up at 6 am)

# Loops: repeat (for example, while the sink is dirty, keep scrubbing)

# Functions: a grouped set of statements to accomplish a task based on parameters (for instnace, given f(x) = x + 5, f(2) would be 7)

# Sequences & Data Structures: store multiple pieces of information, including lists & strings (store the numbers 1-5 or a string containing the letters of the alphabet)
